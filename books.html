                    <h4>
                        For decades, art patrons and philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad have sought to foster public
                        appreciation of postwar and contemporary art. Before founding The Broad museum in Los Angeles,
                        their collection was made accessible by loaning artworks to institutions around the world
                        through The Broad Art Foundation. Since 1984, more than 8,600 loans from The Broad collection
                        have been made to over 500 museums and galleries.

                    <h1>Making Beats: The Art of Sample-Based Hip-Hop:</h1>
                    <h4>
                        Based on ten years of research among hip-hop producers, Making Beats was the first work of
                        scholarship to explore the goals, methods, and values of a surprisingly insular community.
                        Focusing on a variety of subjects—from hip-hop artists’ pedagogical methods to the Afrodiasporic
                        roots of the sampling process to the social significance of “digging” for rare records—Joseph G.
                        Schloss examines the way hip-hop artists have managed to create a form of expression that
                        reflects their creative aspirations, moral beliefs, political values, and cultural realities.
                        This second edition of the book includes a new foreword by Jeff Chang and a new afterword by the
                        author.

                        Hip hop is one of the most dominant and influential cultures in America, giving new voice to the
                        younger generation. It defines a generation's worldview. Exploring hip hop's beginnings up to
                        the present day, Jeff Chang and Dave "Davey D" Cook provide a provocative look into the new
                        world that the hip hop generation has created.

                        unforgettable portraits of many of hip hops forebears.
